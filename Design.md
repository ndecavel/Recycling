## Objective
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to use Machine Learning techniques, specifically Classification, to raise awareness in regards to what can and what should not be recycled. The final product will be in the form of an app that a consumer can use to identify individual items according to their county’s regulations. <br />
  
##  Background
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recycling as we know it in the United States truly became a part of our culture following World War II. More specifically, during the environmentalist movements in the 1960s and 70s. Since then it is estimated that recycling has created at least 1 million jobs with total sales being estimated at around $300 billion in 2012. In more relevant terms, it is also estimated that by 2030, a recycling rate of 75% in the U.S. will create 1.1 million new jobs. Globally, the UN predicts that recycling will create 60 million new jobs. <br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is quite an optimistic outlook, there have been recent international decisions that threaten to risk all of the progress that is just now starting to be fully integrated in many American lifestyles. In 2017, China announced a new import policy permanently banning the import of nonindustrial waste. Given that, since 1972 China has imported more than 45% of all plastics, the cost of dealing with our recycling has increased exponentially. Many communities in America can’t afford the new costs of recycling and are defaulting to incineration. <br />
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of the new cost is dealing with plastic contamination and sorting onsite rather than shipping everything to China. This is where machine learning comes into play – we want to provide a service that can help households sort their trash and increase general recycling knowledge so that recycling plants do not have to suffer the consequences of false ‘rules of thumb’. Furthermore, we hope that this app can be extrapolated to work with any recycling regulation based off of an individual’s zip code.
